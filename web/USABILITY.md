# Visualizer usability findings

Running log of website usability issues found while checking desktop and mobile. Each item is fixed in its own change when practical.

## Fixed

### Top-bar spinners were not where the numbers appear

**Where:** header params bar, `Computed Fréchet distance` and `Simplification time`.

**Problem:** While those metrics were loading, the spinner was rendered *before* the label. The numeric value later appeared *after* the label. Users looking at the empty value slot saw no progress indicator, and swapping spinner-for-number also shifted neighboring params.

The Fréchet metric was also omitted until simplification finished, so the whole params row jumped when that chip appeared.

**Fix:** The spinner now lives in a reserved value slot after the label. Both metrics stay visible for the life of a loaded (or loading) trace, so the slot is replaced in place instead of the chip appearing later.

**Evidence:**

- Mobile (390px): `web/usability/mobile-params-metrics.png`
- Markup fixture used for those screenshots: `web/usability/params-metric-states.html`

### Mobile loaded header hid Fréchet distance and simplification time

**Where:** mobile trace screen (`max-width: 720px`) after `body.trace-loaded-mobile`.

**Problem:** The compact loaded header hid all of `.headerBody`, and `#paramsBar` lives inside that node. Computed Fréchet distance and Simplification time were in the DOM with in-slot spinners, but users only saw Back and the title.

**Fix:** The loaded header still hides file controls and start instructions, but keeps `#paramsBar` as a second row under Back / title. On mobile that row shows only Computed Fréchet distance and Simplification time, so the metrics stay on screen while they load and after values arrive.

**Evidence:**

- Markup fixture used for that screenshot: `web/usability/mobile-loaded-params.html`

## Still open

These were noticed while checking desktop and mobile and are not fixed here:

- Desktop drop-hint heading is misspelled as "Intruction".
